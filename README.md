# tsuserver3

A Python-based server for Attorney Online.

Requires Python 3.5+ and PyYAML.

## How to use

* Install the latest version of Python. **Python 2 will not work**, as tsuserver3 depends on async/await, which can only be found on Python 3.5 and newer.
  - If your system supports it, it is recommended that you use a separate virtual environment, such as [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for Windows, or [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) for everyone else (it runs itself using Python).
* Open Command Prompt or your terminal, and change to the directory where you downloaded tsuserver3 to. You can do this in two ways:
  - Go up one folder above the tsuserver3 folder, Shift + right click the tsuserver3 folder, and click `Open command window here`. This is the easiest method.
  - Copy the path of the tsuserver3 folder, open the terminal, and type in `cd "[paste here]"`, excluding the brackes, but including the quotation marks if the path contains spaces.
* To install PyYAML and dependencies, type in the following:
  ```bash
  python -m pip --user install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  If you are using Windows and have both Python 2 and 3 installed, you may do the following:
  ```batch
  py -3 -m pip --user install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  This operation should not require administrator privileges, unless you decide to remove the `--user` option.
* Rename `config_sample` to `config` and edit the values to your liking. Be sure to check your YAML file for syntax errors. *Use spaces only; do not use tabs.*
* Run by either double-clicking `start_server.py` or typing in `python start_server.py`, or `py -3 start_server.py` if you use both Python 2 and 3. It is normal to not see any output once you start the server.
  - To stop the server, press Ctrl+C multiple times.
